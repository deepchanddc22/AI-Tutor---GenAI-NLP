What AI - Tutor does???
A LLM ( Google’s Gemini ) powered application which takes study materials ( PDFs ) from user and uses the content in the PDF to create MCQs and conduct the same as a test and also provides the user the total marks obtained from the test and also assisting with right explanations to the answers.

Motivation for the project:
Back in 2019 I was just entering my 12th standard and CBSE had announced that there will be a change in paper pattern, where each paper will consist of 20 MCQs. So at that time there no MCQ materials to prepare from :( the struggle was real solving tricky MCQs.
Even today MCQs are part of CBSE exam pattern, so I thought to use the power of LLM to create such an application to help students prepare for MCQs
